PointFinder:

Implements:

* Bower module management
* Grunt managed file copying, updating, jshint, minification
* Inject.js module loading.
* Unit testing (JSTestDriver) with full inject.js compatability.
* The actual unit tests are a bit weak, but more than adequate for now.

ToDo:

------*  Could cleanup javascript a bit more.  Improve modules. (low)
------*  Could decouple javascript from html (low)
*  check that jquery, jquery.mobile are coming from CommonPX and not web
