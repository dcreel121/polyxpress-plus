	- When user starts story create new feed.

Questions: 
	What exactly happens when you were previously logged in to PolyXpress, but then closed the app and restarted it. It still has the cookie so it automatically signs you in, but where is that in the code. I would maybe like to recheck the users facebook friends at that time. Right now I can only seem to find the part in the code if the user's account is unlinked. What exactly does unlinked mean? 

	Where in the code is a story declared as fininshed? (Once all chapters are completed?) Need to change feed to completed at this point in the code.
